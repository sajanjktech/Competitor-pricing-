We will make \na further €2.5m donation (€4m total) to fund the Ryanair \nSustainable Aviation Research Centre. \nThe Research Centre examines Sustainable Aviation Fuel \n(SAF), zero carbon aircraft propulsion systems and non-CO2 \nEmissions.\nWe have retrofitted 60% of our Boeing 737-800NG fleet \nwith split scimitar winglet technology (target 409 by 2026). \nThese winglets reduce carbon emissions and fuel burn by \napproximately 1.5%, while lowering take off noise by over 6% \nand decreasing NOx emissions by 8%.\nRyanair has long campaigned for EU reform to ensure Air \nTraffic Control (ATC) centers are fully staffed but ATC delays \nare getting worse. Ryanair calls on all passengers to visit \nthe ‘Air Traffic Control Ruined Your Flight’ webpage \n(www.atcruinedourholiday.com) and demand that national \nTransport Ministers take action to properly manage and staff \ntheir national ATC services to avoid unnecessary ATC delays \nand unnecessary emissions.\nSAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%. \nWe have an industry leading target of 12.5% of our 2030 fuel \nrequirements coming from SAF. This summer, Ryanair is using \na 2% SAF blend at European Union and UK airports\n*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the term for all aviation fuels that, unlike conventional aviation fuel, are produced without the use of fossil feedstocks such as crude \noil, and also meet established sustainability criteria. The SAF used by Ryanair meets the requirements of the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II). \nUsing SAF results in a reduction in carbon emissions compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces over the lifecycle of the fuel. Emission reductions are predominately \nachieved during the production process and through the use of sustainable feedstocks. The emissions from its combustion in an aircraft engine are effectively the same \nas those of fossil fuels.\nRYANAIR SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH CENTRE\nSCIMITAR WINGLET INSTALLATION\nAIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT REFORM\nSUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF)*\nRyanair extends Trinity College Dublin partnership to 2030\n60%\nof our Boeing 737-\n800NG fleet retrofitted \nwith split scimitar \nwinglet technology\nSIGN THE PETITION\n"}
