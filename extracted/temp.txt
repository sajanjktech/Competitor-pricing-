RYANAIR AND THE ENVIRONMENT
We support the 2015 Paris Agreement, Destination 2050, the United Nations Global Compact and the 17 UN 
Sustainable Development Goals. Here are some examples of our recent sustainable aviation commitments.
RYANAIR SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH CENTRE
We announced the extension of our partnership with Trinity 
College Dublin out to the end of the decade. We will make 
a further €2.5m donation (€4m total) to fund the Ryanair 
Sustainable Aviation Research Centre. 
GREAT VALUE 
AIRPORT TRANSFERS
Pre-book your airport transfer through Ryanair and make your travel experience seamless.
Book a bus, train, or private transfer to pick you up from the airport and bring you to your destination.
The Research Centre examines Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
(SAF), zero carbon aircraft propulsion systems and non-CO2 
Emissions.
SCIMITAR WINGLET INSTALLATION
We have retrofitted 60% of our Boeing 737-800NG fleet 
with split scimitar winglet technology (target 409 by 2026). 
These winglets reduce carbon emissions and fuel burn by 
approximately 1.5%, while lowering take off noise by over 6% 
and decreasing NOx emissions by 8%.
AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT REFORM
Ryanair has long campaigned for EU reform to ensure Air 
Traffic Control (ATC) centers are fully staffed but ATC delays 
are getting worse. Ryanair calls on all passengers to visit 
the ‘Air Traffic Control Ruined Your Flight’ webpage 
(www.atcruinedourholiday.com) and demand that national 
Transport Ministers take action to properly manage and staff 
their national ATC services to avoid unnecessary ATC delays 
and unnecessary emissions.
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF)*
SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%. 
We have an industry leading target of 12.5% of our 2030 fuel 
requirements coming from SAF. This summer, Ryanair is using 
a 2% SAF blend at European Union and UK airports
*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the term for all aviation fuels that, unlike conventional aviation fuel, are produced without the use of fossil feedstocks such as crude 
oil, and also meet established sustainability criteria. The SAF used by Ryanair meets the requirements of the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II). 
Using SAF results in a reduction in carbon emissions compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces over the lifecycle of the fuel. Emission reductions are predominately 
achieved during the production process and through the use of sustainable feedstocks. The emissions from its combustion in an aircraft engine are effectively the same 
as those of fossil fuels.
