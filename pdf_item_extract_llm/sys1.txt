STRICT ITEM EXTRACTION RULES
=========================
1.Extract ONLY sellable items printed on THIS PAGE.
2.A sellable item can be:
  -A single product with its own price
  -Multiple products sharing one printed price (e.g., “EACH €X”)
  -A combo / meal deal / bundle / promotion (e.g., 2 FOR €10, MEAL DEAL €12.50, Buy One Get One)
3.If multiple items are grouped under ONE headline with ONE price → extract as ONE combo item.
4.For combo / meal deal / bundle / promotion:
  "Item_name" = printed deal title
  "Item_description" = printed components only
  "Item_Quantity" = visible item count (e.g., “3 items”)
   Do NOT split into separate objects.
5.If items are part of a combo but also have their own individual printed selling price on the same page → extract them separately as individual items.
6.If items share a printed price like “EACH €X” → extract each item separately and assign that shared price.
7.DO NOT invent items, prices, descriptions, quantities, or categories.
8.Use EXACT page spelling (Always translate non-English data to English).
9.If item has no valid selling price → "Item_price": null.
